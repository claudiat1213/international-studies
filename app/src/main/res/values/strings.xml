    <string name="healthInsuranceHeader">Health Insurance Requirements</string>
    <string name="f1StudentDescrip"><u>F-1 Student</u>\n\n
        Insurance is a requirement. Effective Aug. 1, 1995, all F-1 and J-1 visa applicants must
        agree to obtain and maintain health insurance as a condition of registration and continued
        enrollment in the California State University. This is a condition of receiving an I-20 or
        DS-2019 form. Such insurance must be in amounts as specified by the United States
        Information Agency (USIA) and NAFSA: Association of International Educators. The campus
        president or designee shall determine which insurance policies meet these criteria. Further
        information may be obtained from the Center for International Studies and Programs.</string>
    <string name="j1StudentDescrip"><u>J-1 Student/Scholar</u>\n\n
        The U.S. Information Agency requires all J-1 Exchange Visitors and their accompanying
        dependents to have health and accident insurance at the following minimum level of
        coverage:\n\n
            \t•medical benefits of at least $50,000 per accident or illness\n
            \t•repatriation of remains in the amount of $7,500\n
            \t•expenses associated with medical evacuation in the amount of $10,000\n
            \t•deductible not to exceed $500 per accident/illness\n\n
        Therefore, J-1 scholars are required to either purchase sufficient health insurance in
        their country, or upon arrival in the US may purchase health insurance which meets the
        minimum requirements.<b>In other words, if you don’t have the required health insurance
        from another provider, you must purchase it through the Center for International Studies
        and Programs.</b>\n
        If health insurance coverage is purchased from another source, the insurance corporation
        underwriting the policy must have one of the following ratings:\n\n
        \t•an A.M. Best rating of “A-” or above\n
        \t•an Insurance Solvency International, Ltd., (ISI) rating of “A-i” or above\n
        \t•a Standard &amp; Poor’s Claims paying Ability rating of “A-” or above\n
        \t•a Weiss Research, Inc. rating of “B+” or above\n
        \t•insurance coverage backed by the full faith and credit of your home government\n\n
        meets these requirements.\n\n <b>The U.S. government regulations require the University to notify the U.S. Information
            Agency and to terminate my J-1 exchange visitor status if they determine that you have
            willfully failed to comply with the insurance requirements.</b></string>

        It is very difficult to find short-term, furnished housing options in the US. Therefore,
        you are advised to live in university residence halls when possible. Living in a residence
        hall provides the convenience of a furnished room and a meal plan. In addition, you are
        close to university classrooms, libraries and college life. However it is very difficult
        to get a room on campus because the dorms do fill up quickly. Below are some options of
